# NOTES:
# The # Symbol at the start of a line counts as a Comment. To include in dialog, use a \#
# The . Symbol will cause a pause unless escaped with \. (ex: Mr. Oshiro has a pause, Mr\. Oshiro does not)
# Newlines automatically create a Page Break, unless there is an {n} command on the previous line
# Commands: Anything inside of curly braces {...} is a command and should not be translated.
 

# Inline Text Commands:
# {~}wavy text{/~}
# {!}impact text{/!}
# {>> x}changes speed at which characters are displayed{>>}
# {# 000000}this text is black{#} (uses HEX color values)
# {+MENU_BEGIN} inserts the dialog from the MENU_BEGIN value (in English, "CLIMB")
# {n} creates a newline, without a page break
# {0.5} creates a 0.5 second pause, or alternatively more or less, it depends on how you set the number to be
# {big}this text is large{/big}

[MADELINE left sad]
keep in mind that I must use these () to explain it, but YOU must use these ][ for it to work
so )=] (=[

heagridswagerdadbothelpdialogflip=
[MADELINE left normal]
if you put character on right

[MADELINE right normal]
it will flip the picture automatically

[MADELINE left normal]
but sometimes you need something like

[MADELINE left normal flip]
this

[MADELINE right normal flip]
you can achieve this by writing flip after expression

[MADELINE left normal flip]
so: (character direction expression flip)

[MADELINE left normal upsidedown]
EVERY character can be upside down if you write upsidedown after expression
(character direction expression upsidedown)

[MADELINE left normal pop]
you can make  picture to pop

[MADELINE left normal pop]
it is a weird effect that looks like this, pay attention to picture

[MADELINE left normal pop]
see?

[MADELINE left normal pop]
you achieve this by writing pop after expression

[MADELINE left normal pop]
(character direction expression pop)

[MADELINE left normal upsidedown flip pop]
you can all combinate effects
(character direction expression upsidedown flip pop) in any order

[MADELINE left determined upsidedown flip pop]
all things can be used on EVERY character, directions and expressions work

[MADELINE left distracted]
you may also change expression by [MADELINE left normal] typing the text command in middle of line

[MADELINE left normal]
something like this:  character is talking {0.5}[MADELINE left distracted] (character direction expression) character is talking again

[MADELINE left normal]
