	[BADELINE right scoff] Not gonna lie, this is really cool!
	[MADELINE left determined] I wanna climb that {~}scaffolding{/~}...
	[BADELINE right serious] Isn't that a bit too easy for you?
	[MADELINE left distracted] Don't worry, I sometimes like myself a chill climb!	
	[BADELINE right scoff] I think I got an idea tho...	
	[MADELINE left surprised] Oh no, not again!
	[BADELINE right scoff] You wanna have a {~}{#a0e6ff}snowball fight{#}{/~}?

	[BADELINE right normal] I think I got an idea how you could get up right there!
	[MADELINE left normal] What do you have in mind?
	[BADELINE right normal] You just have to dash onto one of my snowballs!
	[BADELINE right scoff] Just try to not let me headshot you...
	[MADELINE left upset] Then aim properly for once.

	[BADELINE right worried] Come on,{0.5} wasn't it at least a bit fun?
	[MADELINE left sad] It was a bit too fast paced for my taste.
	[MADELINE left normal] On the bright side, some of these gaps would've been too big to get over without you.
	[BADELINE right normal] You're welcome!!
	[MADELINE left upset] Your snowballs got a {*}lot{/*} of punch tho...
	[BADELINE right normal] Thanks!

This path will give you two dashes if you go through it.
it is meant to give players who dislike this type of gameplay an easier time with this level.
I don't want to force anyone into a situation where they are frustrated and annoyed by my maps.
Thank you.

	[THEO right normal] I heard there is a {# 15c217}{~}gym{/~}{#} to the left
	[THEO right normal] Wanna check it out? I saw a {# d41f1c}berry{#} in there

#gym
	#gym presentation
	wymiki_gym_r0=
		Welcome to the gym
		This gym has 5 tech room, and a berry room
		To enter any of them, swim up the water and enter any of the holes
		The first hole will bring you back to the hub
		While the last hole will bring you to the berry
		The first tech room is really important if you are aiming to finish this , make sure to master it
		GL and HF ^^ <3
	#Core block entity displacement / Bounce block entity displacement presentation
	wymiki_gym_r3=
		Welcome to the Core block entity displacement gym room, this trick can only be perfomed on fire mode
		To perform Core/Bounce block entity displacement, first, break the core block
		Secondly, for commodity, place your self inside the core block respawn position, stopping it from respawning
		Wait until when the core block can instantly respawn upon leaving
		Leave the core block respawn position and rapidly grab it before it even starts to spawn in, then, release quickly to instantly break the coreblock
		If perform properly, entities attached to the core block will stay displaced while the coreblock stays broken
		To pet the cat, stop the core block from respawning with your Theo crystal, so you can use the entities attached
		To come back, use a demo dash on the gap it leaves undearneath
		The displacement depends on from where you perform the trick, the higher you do it, the lower the entities will go and vice versa
		Try performing it from the spiked side and/or with a neutral theo drop
		Get comfortable with this tech as you will be required to perform it in mid-air situations
		The name can be shortened by ced or bed
	#Lava-ice neutrals presentation
	wymiki_gym_r2=
		Welcome to the lava/ice neutral/climb room
		This is a dashless tech that allows you to use lava/ice walls on your advantage
		For climbing, perform your self on the pixel next to the wall, in this room you may use the switch block to aling properly
		Then just climb jump normally
		For neutral climbing, jump into the wall and buffer jump withing 5f of touching the wall
		You will also need to stop holding any direction upon doing the jump (like a normal neutral climb)
		Both of this can be performed with theo, but he will make matters worse
	#Dream zipline wall boost 
	wymiki_gym_r1=
		This tech isn't use much on the map but is good to know
		It is based on momentum carry
		In this setup you execute a wallbounce by jumping while you still have the liftboost from the zip dream block
		Basically, execute a dream jump and jump again quickly to wallbounce off the core block in front
	#Dream smuggle
	wymiki_gym_r4=
		This tech is called dream smuggle
		For this map, diagonal dream smuggling has been tweaked to give the same window as a horizontal smuggle
		The tech can be performed from any side of the dream block except from the top (downwards)
		To do it, position your self close to the dream block, throw/drop theo and dash into the dream block
		Before entering the dream block, regrab theo
		If done properly, you will have theo at the other side
		If you perform a dream grab at the other side, you can even dash while holding theo
	#C-POP NOOOOO
	wymiki_gym_r5=
		C-pop
		Search for a tutorial, gl
		But to sum up
		Hold to the lowest point of the ledge, hold the direction you wanna go to, and press the down button for some frames
		Upon falling, quickly jump
		If done properly, you should get to the next switch block

	[BADELINE right normal] Missed me darling?
	[MADELINE left upset] What do you want now?
	[BADELINE right normal] Well, just saying, this rooms seems to have no exit
	[BADELINE right normal] Better to backtrack uh?
	[MADELINE right upset] Is this one of your works?
