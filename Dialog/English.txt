	[MADELINE left normal] Look at all this {~}{#a0e6ff}snow{#}{/~}!
	[BADELINE right scoff] Not gonna lie, this is really cool!
	[MADELINE left determined] I wanna climb that {~}scaffolding{/~}...
	[BADELINE right serious] Isn't that a bit too easy for you?
	[MADELINE left distracted] Don't worry, I sometimes like myself a chill climb!	
	[BADELINE right scoff] I think I got an idea tho...	
	[MADELINE left surprised] Oh no, not again!
	[BADELINE right scoff] You wanna have a {~}{#a0e6ff}snowball fight{#}{/~}?	
	[MADELINE left upset] I guess I can't say no, can I?

	[BADELINE right normal] I think I got an idea how you could get up right there!
	[MADELINE left normal] What do you have in mind?
	[BADELINE right normal] You just have to dash onto one of my snowballs!
	[BADELINE right scoff] Just try to not let me headshot you...
	[MADELINE left upset] Then aim properly for once.

	[MADELINE left distracted] Yeah, I guess...	
	[MADELINE left upset] {1.2}{>> 0.7}If I'm honest, I prefer not having snow all over my face.{>>}
	[BADELINE right worried] Come on,{0.5} wasn't it at least a bit fun?
	[MADELINE left sad] It was a bit too fast paced for my taste.
	[MADELINE left normal] On the bright side, some of these gaps would've been too big to get over without you.
	[BADELINE right normal] You're welcome!!
	[MADELINE left upset] Your snowballs got a {*}lot{/*} of punch tho...
