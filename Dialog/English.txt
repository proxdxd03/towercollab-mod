	[MADELINE left normal] Look at all this {~}{#a0e6ff}snow{#}{/~}!
	[BADELINE right scoff] Not gonna lie, this is really cool!
	[MADELINE left determined] I wanna climb that {~}scaffolding{/~}...
	[BADELINE right serious] Isn't that a bit too easy for you?
	[MADELINE left distracted] Don't worry, I sometimes like myself a chill climb!	
	[BADELINE right scoff] I think I got an idea tho...	
	[MADELINE left surprised] Oh no, not again!
	[BADELINE right scoff] You wanna have a {~}{#a0e6ff}snowball fight{#}{/~}?	
	[MADELINE left upset] I guess I can't say no, can I?

Towercollab_proxdxd03_snowballfight_sideberry=
	{0.3}[MADELINE left surprised] Where do you get {*}THAT{/*} many snowballs from!?!?
	[BADELINE right scoff] Well, I had some practice when you tried to golden the {~}{#e8b923}Golden Ridge{#}{/~} back then...
	[MADELINE left upset] Come on, I didn't take that long...

Towercollab_proxdxd03_snowballfight_snowballsuper=
	{anchor bottom}
	[BADELINE right scoff] Oh, you're gonna like this one!
	[MADELINE left upset] I'm so scared...
	[BADELINE right normal] I think I got an idea how you could get up right there!
	[MADELINE left normal] What do you have in mind?
	[BADELINE right normal] You just have to dash onto one of my snowballs!
	[BADELINE right scoff] Just try to not let me headshot you...
	[MADELINE left upset] Then aim properly for once.

	[BADELINE right freakA] Oh my god...
	[BADELINE right freakB] {>> 0.2}this was {0.4}{*}{!}SOOOO{/!}{/*}{>>} fun!!
	[MADELINE left distracted] Yeah, I guess...	
	[MADELINE left upset] {1.2}{>> 0.7}If I'm honest, I prefer not having snow all over my face.{>>}
	[BADELINE right worried] Come on,{0.5} wasn't it at least a bit fun?
	[MADELINE left sad] It was a bit too fast paced for my taste.
	[MADELINE left normal] On the bright side, some of these gaps would've been too big to get over without you.
	[BADELINE right normal] You're welcome!!
	[MADELINE left upset] Your snowballs got a {*}lot{/*} of punch tho...
	[BADELINE right normal] Thanks!
	[BADELINE right scoff] I gotta invite {~}{#009150}Theo{#}{/~} to a snowball fight over here some day...
	[BADELINE right scoff] Anyways, see you later!

This path will give you two dashes if you go through it.
it is meant to give players who dislike this type of gameplay an easier time with this level.
I don't want to force anyone into a situation where they are frustrated and annoyed by my maps.
Thank you.

[THEO right normal]

[MADELINE left distracted]

Wait, you really think this is a good idea?

[MADELINE left upset]
What makes you think it isn't, uh?

[BADELINE right upset]
Well, we have been climbing this tower for forever now

[BADELINE right worried]
What makes you believe it's gonna be possible to reach the top?

[BADELINE right upset]
The levels have only gotten harder and harder...

[MADELINE right sad]
.{o.3}.{o.3}.

[BADELINE right worried]

[THEO right worried]
I would leave to give ya girls space but...
		
[MADELINE left upset]
Don't worry, I think she finished bothering

Well, just saying, this rooms seems to have no exit

Better to backtrack uh?

[MADELINE right upset]
Is this one of your works?
