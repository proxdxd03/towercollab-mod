	[MADELINE left normal] What do you have in mind?
	[BADELINE right normal] You just have to dash onto one of my snowballs!
	[BADELINE right scoff] Just try to not let me headshot you...
	[MADELINE left upset] Then aim properly for once.

	[MADELINE left sad] It was a bit too fast paced for my taste.
	[MADELINE left normal] On the bright side, some of these gaps would've been too big to get over without you.
	[BADELINE right normal] You're welcome!!
	[MADELINE left upset] Your snowballs got a {*}lot{/*} of punch tho...

    [MADELINE_MIRROR left normal] {>> 2}this one is for all of you celeste tech enjoyers who always want to find new weird tricks
    in case u couldnt already tell this is a chained ultra
    but dont you worry, this is not a normal ultra \(were not boring\)
    you see, all this map we already used seekers in every room, so why stop there...
    muahahahaha
    this is in fact the worlds first intended SULTRA™️!
    you get it? a seeker ultra
    yea, dont worry, its simple
    just stun the seeker and use the respawn boost to start your ultra
    the thing on the right is a speed shatter block btw, so u gotta go fast
    ohh, and dont forget bumper boost mechanics, they might come in handy{>>}

This path will give you two dashes if you go through it.
it is meant to give players who dislike this type of gameplay an easier time with this level.
I don't want to force anyone into a situation where they are frustrated and annoyed by my maps.
Thank you.

	[MADELINE left surprised] THEOO?!?!
	[THEO right normal] That's me!
	[MADELINE left deadpan] How did you end {~}up here{/~}?
	[MADELINE left distracted] How do I keep finding you in this tower?
	[THEO right normal]	Oh trust me, I wish I knew
	[THEO right normal]	Question is, how it is you keep on climbing?
	[THEO right normal]	I keep on getting {~}climb blocked{/~} ice-rock solid
	[MADELINE left normal] That's your best joke?
	[THEO right normal] Maybe...{0.10} Anyways
	[THEO right normal] Guess is {# 15c217}{~}our{/~} lucky day{#}, would mind lending me a hand?
	[MADELINE left normal] No worries, sure!
		{ph_trigger baddy_split -25 0 true}
	[BADELINE right normal] Wait, you really think this is a good idea?
	[MADELINE left upset] What makes you think it isn't, uh?
	[BADELINE right upset] Well, as theo said
	[BADELINE right upset] We have been climbing this tower for ages now
	[BADELINE right worried] What makes you believe it's gonna be possible to reach the top?
	[BADELINE right upset] You barelly finished the lasts levels...
	[MADELINE right sad] .{0.3}.{0.3}.
	[BADELINE right worried] ... I'm just worried it will hit you harder to back down later than if you give up now
	[THEO right worried] I would leave to give ya girls space but...
	[MADELINE left upset] Don't worry, I think she finished bothering
	[BADELINE right upset] Good luck {+MADELINE}...
		{ph_trigger baddy_vanish}
	[THEO right normal] Don't worry {+MADELINE}, you know her
	[THEO right normal] Is probably just another one of her tantrums
	[THEO right normal] I heard there is a {# 15c217}{~}gym{/~}{#} to the left
	[THEO right normal] Wanna check it out? I saw a {# d41f1c}berry{#} in there

#gym
	#gym presentation
	wymiki_gym_r0=
		Welcome to the gym.
		This gym has 5 tech rooms, and a berry room.
		To enter any of them, swim up the water and enter one of the holes.
		The first hole will bring you back to this hub.
		While the last hole will bring you to the berry.
		The first tech room is really important if you are aiming to finish this, make sure to master it.
		GL and HF ^^ <3
	#Core block entity displacement / Bounce block entity displacement presentation
	wymiki_gym_r3=
		Welcome to the Core block entity displacement gym room, this trick can only be perfomed on fire mode.
		To perform Core/Bounce block entity displacement, first, break the core block,
		Secondly, for consistency, place your self inside the core block respawn position, stopping it from respawning.
		Wait until when the core block can instantly respawn upon leaving.
		Leave the core block respawn position and immediately grab it before it even finishes spawning in, then, release quickly to instantly break the coreblock.
		If performed properly, entities attached to the core block will stay displaced while the coreblock stays broken.
		To pet the cat, stop the core block from respawning with your Theo crystal, so you can use the entities attached.
		To come back, use a demo dash on the gap it leaves undearneath.
		The displacement depends on where you perform the trick from, the higher you do it, the lower the entities will go and vice versa.
		Try performing it from the spiked side and/or with a neutral theo drop.
		Get comfortable with this tech as you will be required to perform it in mid-air situations.
		The name can be shortened to ced or bed.
	#Lava-ice neutrals presentation
	wymiki_gym_r2=
		Welcome to the lava/ice neutral/climb room.
		This is a dashless tech that allows you to use lava/ice walls on your advantage.
		For climbing, position your self on the pixel next to the wall, in this room you may use the switch block to align properly.
		Then just climbjump normally.
		For neutral climbing, jump into the wall and buffer jump within 5f of touching the wall.
		You will also need to stop holding any directions a few frames before doing the jump to avoid hitting the lava.
		Both of these can be performed with theo, but he will make matters worse.
	#Dream zipline wall boost 
	wymiki_gym_r1=
		This tech isn't used much in the map but is good to know.
		It is sometimes referred to as a momentum carry.
		In this setup you execute a higher than usual walljump by jumping while you still have the liftboost from the zip dream block.
		Basically, execute a dream jump and jump again quickly to wallbounce off the core block in front.
	#Dream smuggle
	wymiki_gym_r4=
		This tech is called dream smuggle.
		For this map, diagonal dream smuggling has been tweaked to give the same window as a horizontal smuggle.
		The tech can be performed from any side of the dream block however performing it from the top is much more precise (and will not be required).
		To do it, position your self close to the dream block, throw/drop theo and dash into the dream block.
		Before entering the dream block, regrab theo.
		If done properly, you will have theo at the other side.
		If you perform a dream grab at the other side, you can even dash while holding theo.
	#C-POP NOOOOO
	wymiki_gym_r5=
		Ceiling Pop
		Search for a tutorial, gl.
		But to sum it up.
		Hold to the lowest point of the wall, hold the direction you wanna go to, and press the down button for some frames.
		Upon sliding below the wall, quickly jump.
		If done properly you should get to the next switch block.

	[BADELINE right normal] Missed me darling?
	[MADELINE left upset] What do you want now?
	[BADELINE right normal] Well, just saying, this rooms seems to have no exit
	[BADELINE right normal] Better to backtrack uh?
	[MADELINE right upset] Is this one of your works?
